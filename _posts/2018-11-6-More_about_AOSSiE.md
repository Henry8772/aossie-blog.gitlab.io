The Australian umbrella organization for open-source projects.

We are an Australian not-for-profit umbrella organization for open-source projects. We believe the open-source philosophy provides a resource-efficient channel to transfer knowledge and achieve innovation and education.

In 2018, we offer the following projects:

 - Agora (Scala, Javascript): a library of vote counting algorithms for democratic elections.

 - Mind the Word (Javascript, HTML, CSS): a browser extension that helps users to learn new languages.

 - Crowd Alert (React-Native, Expo, Jest): a cross-platform mobile application that allows users to post and view incidents around them

 - Carbon Footprint (Javascript, HTML, CSS): a browser extension that raises environmental awareness regarding C02 emissions.

 - Starcross (iOS,C++,OpenGL,Objective-C): Starcross is a hand-held planetarium for your iOS device. Can be used to identify stars, planets, nebulae and more.

 - Computational Philosophy (Isabelle): formalizations of philosophical theories and arguments towards computer-assisted metaphysics, as envisaged by Leibniz.

We have a diverse group of mentors, including GSoC students from previous years who decided to become long-term contributors as well as academics with extensive experience in supervising undergraduate, M.Sc. and PhD students on theses and projects, whose results are often published and presented in the most prestigious conferences of our research fields.
